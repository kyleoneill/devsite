# I'm Kyle

I'm a software engineer and web developer.

## Who I am

I graduated from the University at Albany (SUNY) in December of 2018 with a Bachelor's in Digital Forensics. The program had several courses in programming and it quickly became my primary passion.

I previously worked at [capSpire](https://www.capspire.com/) and [Rational Enterprise](https://www.rationalenterprise.com/) and interned at [General Electric](https://www.ge.com/power).
