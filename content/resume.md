# Experience

## WB Games New York

**June 2021 - Present** - QA Engineer

*Troy, New York*

I work on the development of Hydra Studio, services platform written in Python used across Warner Bros. Games to provide network capability for the
organization's video games. Primarily, I write and maintain an end-to-end testing suite written with an internal domain specific language to catch
regressions, add coverage for under-tested features, and test new features to greenlight their release.

I fix bugs that I find in Hydra Studio, and add features to the internal testing DSL to expand its test coverage capabilities. I write load testing
scripts for Hydra Studio tailored to upcoming Warner Bros. games, matching their expected usage pattern of Hydra Studio's API by recording game network
traffic. Scripts simulate projected concurrent users on game release to test Hydra Studio's stability during load, simulating hundreds of thousands of users.

## CapSpire

**June 2019 - February 2020** - Software Developer

*Dallas, Texas*

I developed web apps with a ReactJS frontend and Python backend for multiple clients, both fixing bugs and adding new features. I assisted in a migration of MySQL databases to Hadoop on AWS EMR, translating SQL scripts to PySpark.

## Rational Enterprise

**January 2019 - March 2019** - Junior Developer

**June 2018 - August 2018** - QA Intern

*Albany, New York*

I worked on web app with an AngularJS frontend and Java Spring backend which was designed to help a corporation collect and retain data to prepare for
litigation.

Before being a full time developer, I interned for Rational Enterprise and replaced their deprecated CasperJS based frontend testing suite. I developed a
new one in NodeJS using Puppeteer, and Mocha.

## General Electric

**September 2018 - December 2018** - Emerging Technology Intern

*Schenectady, New York*

I performed independent research on several AWS technologies to find applications that would improve corporate processes. I began by finishing an Alexa for Business pilot which allowed factory workers to locate tools and parts with voice commands to search an inventory database. Following this project, I created a proof-of-concept AI camera using AWS DeepLens and AWS SageMaker. I also came up with potential use cases based on an analysis of company needs, e.g., how to handle authentication for Alexa for Business devices, scanning for safety equipment on workers, and checking inventory. I documented device setup,
troubleshooting, and an evaluation of device security on Confluence pages.

## University at Albany

**May 2017 - May 2018** - IT Support

*Albany, New York*

I surveyed the University at Albany campus to document the status of over 5,000 data/video/voice jacks on Microsoft Excel. The Excel data I recorded was
parsed using a C# WPF application that I wrote to generate a report on the state of data jacks on campus. I performed a security review of SUNY centers documenting how personally identifiable information (PII) was being stored. I updated and managed a MediaWiki service for Microsoft applications, including writing a Python script to locate outdated articles. I also acted as the SUNY Albany switchboard operator using a Pinnacle databse to answer questions about billing, class scheduling, and finding faculty on campus.

# Education

## University at Albany, SUNY

**August 2014 - December 2018**

*Albany, New York*

I attended UAlbany for four and a half years, earning a Bachelor's degree in Digital Forensics. I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a 3.99 GPA.

# Personal Projects

## ChimeraScript

A dynamically typed interpreted language written in Rust. ChimeraScript is primarily designed to test web APIs using SQL-like statements
which allow you to make requests and then make assertions against returned data.

## RustyPNG

A decoder for the [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG) file format, written in Rust during a work hackathon. The application reads a binary .png
file and decodes it, reading the header and all data chunks and then displaying the PNG for the user.

## League Health Reader

A Python application which uses Tesseract OCR to read data off of a players screen while they are playing [League of Legends](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/). The application sends Bluetooth packets to an LED light strip to set its color to match in-game health.
